We are\na high research, comprehensive, nationally ranked university of\nvalue that doesn\u2019t settle. This document captures it all \u2014 how we\ntell our story, convey who we are and share the work we\u2019re doing\nwith others.\nWhat is a brand?\nIt\u2019s more than a logo, a slogan, a\nmascot or an ad campaign. It\u2019s long-\nlasting, with enduring strength. It is\nwhat people think of when they hear\nBowling Green State University.\nA brand is:\nThe promise we make to our\naudiences\nThe essence of our organization\nThe experience we create\nThe personality we convey\nThe message we deliver\nThe identity we express\nWhat will this\ndocument do?\nAs people, our messages are crafted\nbased on who we\u2019re speaking to, the\npersonality infused in them and the\nwords being communicated. The same\ncan be said for a brand.\nThis document will define each\ncomponent of our brand to illustrate\nwho BGSU is and why we matter to\nthe region.\n\fBowling Green State University 4\nIntroduction\nThe Bowling Green State University brand reflects more than a century of\ncreating public good and is recognized throughout the world.\nWhile the Office of Marketing and Brand Strategy is tasked with its\ncultivation and protection, the entire BGSU community has a shared\nresponsibility to be good stewards of the BGSU brand. We want to ensure\nyou have the tools to do so.\nThese brand guidelines serve as a resource as you represent BGSU and\ninclude standards for the use of logos, colors, fonts, images and overall\nvisual identity, as well as messaging and voice.\nWe are here to help you advance the brand through the work of our students,\nfaculty, staff and alumni. If you need further assistance, please contact the\nOffice of Marketing and Brand Strategy at 419-372-2616 or the Athletics\nLicensing Resource Group at 616-395-0676.\n\fVoice\n\fBowling Green State University 6\n| Voice 6\nVoice Overview\nOur message is what we say.\nOur voice is how we say it.\nWe speak in a way that\u2019s true to who we are as an institution.\nExpressing our voice consistently is essential to the success of the\nBGSU brand. It helps us reach new audiences more effectively, and\nforge deeper connections with fellow Falcons.\nWith these voice guidelines, you\u2019ll have what you need to tell our\nstory clearly, compellingly, and yes, consistently.\n\fBowling Green State University 7\n| Strategy 7\nPersonality/Voice\nKeep the sentiment of these traits in mind when\ncrafting communications. Some of these traits will\nbe dialed up or toned down, depending on your\ntopic, audience and channel.\nRATIONAL (THINK)\nFriendly\nWELCOMING, PERSONABLE\nWe treat others with kindness, dignity and respect. And\nit comes through in the approachability of our brand.\nCurious\nEAGER, EXCITED\nOur students are curious about their lives and their\npotential. We encourage it, guide it and see where it\nleads.\nBright\nINTELLECTUAL, FORWARD-LOOKING\nWe\u2019re going to be the 21st-century center of learning.\nEMOTIONAL (FEEL)\nVibrant\nVIVID, DYNAMIC\nWe embrace the uniqueness of Bowling Green. We have\nunconventional traditions. Our colors are unexpected.\nThere\u2019s a lot that may surprise you here.\nCourageous\nBRAVE, GUTSY\nWe defy the status quo to better the lives of those we\nreach.\nConnected\nTOGETHER, ENGAGED\nWe care about each individual and help them connect to\nwhat matters to them and where they\u2019re headed.\n\fBowling Green State University 8\n| Voice 8\nBest Practices\nRegardless of what you\u2019re writing, you want to make sure\nyour message\u2014and our voice\u2014rings clear. Follow these\ntips to ensure that the BGSU ethos comes through.\nKnow your audience.\nIdentify the particular audience you\u2019re trying to reach, or\nnothing you say will reach them.\nFocus on one thing.\nEmphasize a single message. Otherwise, your readers\nare likely to either forget what they\u2019ve read or just stop\nreading.\nMake it personal.\nUse the second-person \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to engage and\nmotivate the reader.\nAvoid jargon.\nWrite clearly and keep your language accessible.\nJargon has its place, but our communications are not it.\nStay away from the passive.\nAmazing things are happening at BGSU. Use an active\nvoice to tell the world about it.\nGive the reader something\nto do.\nAlways include a clear call to action.\nChoose wisely.\nEvery communication needn\u2019t contain every detail. Focus\non what\u2019s both important and relevant\u2014clutter just gets\nin the way of our message.\nIncorporate white space.\nYour readers\u2019 eyes need places to rest so that their brains\ncan digest information. Work with a designer to organize\nyour content visually, making good use of white space.\nAvoid clich\u00e9s.\nIt\u2019s easy to resort to clich\u00e9s: At first blush, they sound\ncatchy. But it\u2019s best to avoid them. Use our personality to\nyour advantage by being original and engaging.\nDon\u2019t force excitement.\nIf the message isn\u2019t something we\u2019d yell, it doesn\u2019t\ndeserve an exclamation point. Use this mark extremely\nsparingly\u2014 or better yet, not at all.\n\fBowling Green State University 9\n| Voice 9\nCrafting Content\nChecklist\nCHECKING OUR VOICE:\nWhen crafting any communication, ask yourself:\nDoes this relate to our core message?\nDoes it sound like something a person with our brand\u2019s\npersonality traits would say?\nDoes it get to the point, or is the key message buried?\nIs at least one of our secondary messages included?\nDo the headlines convey our voice, or are they simply labeling\nthe content?\nIs this appropriate for the intended audience, and does it convey\nthe relevant aspects of our personality?\nDoes it move beyond a simple statement of the facts to reveal\nsomething bigger about BGSU?\nDoes it lead with audience benefits?\nDoes it pay off those benefits with our attributes?\n\fLogo\n\fBowling Green State University 11\n| Logo 11\nLogo Overview\nThe Bowling Green State University\nlogo is one of the most visible and\nrecognizable elements of our identity.\nThe BGSU logo represents us at the very highest\nlevel and is vitally important to our brand. It acts\nas a signature, an identifier and a stamp of quality.\nIt is, and should always be, the most consistent\ncomponent in our communications.\nIn order to maintain this consistency, a few simple\nguidelines should be followed.\n\fBowling Green State University 12\n| Logo 12\nThe Official BGSU Logo\nand How to Use it\nThe BGSU logo is the official identifier and may be used\nonly for purposes that will promote the goals of the\nUniversity.\nAll communications, both print and electronic, published\nby Bowling Green State University, must prominently\ndisplay an approved logo.\n\u2022 Treat the logo as artwork, not as typography. The logo\nshould be treated as a graphic icon.\n\u2022 Other logos that represent an individual academic/\nadministrative area should never appear on stationery.\nThis includes office letterheads, envelopes and business\ncards. However, individual area marks can be used on\nmaterials other than stationery as long as the BGSU\nlogo appears prominently.\nBGSU Logo\n\fBowling Green State University 13\n| Logo 13\nApproved Colors\nONE-COLOR APPLICATIONS\nWhen using a single color, the BGSU logo should be\nprinted in orange, brown or black.\nTWO OR MORE COLOR APPLICATIONS\nIf using the BGSU logo in two colors, only orange and\nblack may be used as shown. The BGSU logo may be\nreversed to white if appearing on a dark background.\nOne-Color Applications\nReversed on Dark Background\n\fBowling Green State University 14\n| Logo 14\nThings to Avoid\nAvoid these pitfalls when using the logo.\nDON\u2019T skew, stretch or bend the logo in any way.\nDON\u2019T use extreme drop shadows or other visual effects.\nDON\u2019T apply brand treatments to the logo.\nDON\u2019T outline the logo.\nDON\u2019T rotate the logo.\nDON\u2019T use any colors other than those specified\nin this document.\nDON\u2019T crop the logo.\nDON\u2019T apply the logo to a background that doesn\u2019t\nprovide adequate contrast.\n\fBowling Green State University 15\n| Logo 15\nSpacing\nIn designing our logo, careful attention was paid to\nhow it scales up and down, ensuring legibility at any\nsize. It\u2019s important that the logo always be prominent\nand legible, so keep these considerations in mind\nwhen using it in layout.\nCLEAR SPACE\nWhen using the logo, include enough clear space to set it apart from other design elements.\nUse half the width of the G in BGSU as a measuring tool to help maintain clearance.\n1/2 of Letter G = X Height\nMINIMUM SIZE\nTo ensure legibility, follow these size requirements. When reproduced any smaller than\nthese sizes, the logo becomes difficult to read and illegible.\n.75\u201d or 100px\n\fBowling Green State University 16\n| Logo 16\nOther University Logos\nINTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS LOGOS\nIntercollegiate Athletics logos are the exclusive marks that represent the\nBGSU Falcons.

Never use secondary\ncolors in this way. By leading with our primary colors,\nwe can celebrate the pride we have in our institution and\nincorporate a thoughtful amount of negative space. Rather\nthan viewing white space as a blank area, think of it as a\npause. Whether it\u2019s in a photo or a layout, don\u2019t rush to fill\nnegative space. What\u2019s absent can focus attention on the\ncontent that\u2019s there.\nRatios on individual pages, spreads, layouts and even\nfull communications can vary. The important thing\nto remember is that our primary colors should be the\npredominant colors overall. When viewing all the pieces\nthe university creates and applying the \u201csquint test\u201d to the\nbrand as a whole, the balance of color should feel close to\nwhat\u2019s shown here.\n50%\n30%\n20%\n\fBowling Green State University 21\n| Color 21\nSample Palettes\nUsing color is an easy way to evoke energy and emotion\nwithin our communications. The use of these colors is\nnot required but illustrates proportional adjustments\nthroughout a designed piece. Reference these sample\ncombinations that demonstrate consistent use of primary\ncolors and white space as well as restrained use of\nsecondary colors for balanced emphasis.\n\fTypography\n\fBowling Green State University 23\n| Typography 23\nTypography Overview\nWhen it\u2019s used thoughtfully, typography becomes a\npowerful brand tool that can add visual meaning to what\nwe say.\nThe BGSU brand uses a variety of typefaces, that offer\nflexibility and balance, across all communications and for\na variety of audiences.\n- Kepler is our sophisticated serif that is used for\nheadlines and subheads.\n- Europa is our workhorse sans that complements\nKepler by being used at mostly small sizes in subheads\nand body copy.\n- Univers Roman is the font for our body copy.

Leading should be set tight,\nbut not too tight. Univers generally look\nbest with leading set slightly looser than\nthe default.\nA good rule of thumb is to start with\nleading that\u2019s two points higher than\nthe point size of the text. This won\u2019t\nalways be right, but leading can be\nadjusted easily from there.\nLeading that\u2019s too loose leaves\ntoo much pause between lines.\n17 PT. TYPE/30 PT. LEADING\nLeading that\u2019s too tight leaves\ntoo little pause between lines.\n17 PT. TYPE/14 PT. LEADING\nWhen leading is correct, the\nreader won\u2019t even notice.\n17 PT. TYPE/20 PT. LEADING\nTRACKING\nCorrect letterspacing, called tracking,\nalso helps make the type easy to\nread. Outside of headlines, it\u2019s usually\nacceptable to use the default tracking;\nhowever, you may need to increase\ntracking at smaller sizes, and decrease it\nat larger sizes. Optical kerning should be\nused when available.\nThe term \u201ctracking\u201d refers to overall\nletterspacing for groups of letters and\nentire blocks of text. The term \u201ckerning\u201d\nrefers to selective letterspacing between\npairs of characters.\nTracking that\u2019s too loose leaves\ntoo much space between letters.\n+75 TRACKING\nTrackingthat\u2019stootightleavestoo\nlittlespacebetweenletters.\n-75 TRACKING\nWhen tracking is correct,\nthe reader won\u2019t even notice.\n-10 TRACKING\nHint\nTrust your eye. If the space between\nlines or characters looks too tight or\ntoo loose, it probably is. Remember,\nthe main purpose of leading and\ntracking is to make it quick and easy\nfor readers to digest multiple lines of\ncopy.\n\fBowling Green State University 28\n| Typography 28\nTypesetting Examples\nThe following pages show just a few examples of how we\ncan combine our different typefaces to establish hierarchy\nand create visual interest in a layout. There are many ways\nthis can be done, so use these samples as a baseline and\nmodify them as needed.\nIn the heart of the\nheartland, built on\ngrit and resiliency\nWhen using Kepler in headlines,\nreserve the use of italics for calling\nout keywords.

Some of these traits will be dialed up or toned down, depending on your topic, audience and channel.\n\nKnow your audience. Identify the particular audience you\u2019re trying to reach, or nothing you say will reach them;\nFocus on one thing. Emphasize a single message. Otherwise, your readers are likely to either forget what they\u2019ve read or just stop reading.\nMake it personal. Use the second-person \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to engage and motivate the reader.\nAvoid jargon. Write clearly and keep your language accessible. Jargon has its place, but our communications are not it.\nStay away from the passive. Amazing things are happening at BGSU. Use an active\nvoice to tell the world about it.\nGive the reader something\nto do. Always include a clear call to action.\nChoose wisely. Every communication needn\u2019t contain every detail.

Work with a designer to organize your content visually, making good use of white space.\nAvoid clich\u00e9s. It\u2019s easy to resort to clich\u00e9s: At first blush, they sound catchy. But it\u2019s best to avoid them. Use our personality to your advantage by being original and engaging.\nDon\u2019t force excitement.

The glow is developed to be use\nsparingly, to make text more legible. The color of the\nglow can be our lighter colors of our supplemental color\noptions or a tone of the color to better blend in the design.\nThe edges of the glow should be soft enough to not notice\nwhere it ends.;\nRadius on images and shapes: Adding a .25 for print, 12 px for digital, to images or shapes matches the tag element. It shouldn\u2019t be over used and can be used with square images and shapes. When overlaying elements, both hard and curved edges can be used.\nTags: Tags are a highly flexible visual element that can serve a number of purposes. They can be used as labels for content, create emphasis, or as a wayfinding device. In digital applications they can used as a filter, button, displaying selected options and the corresponding content. Tags are a great way to incorporate secondary colors but should not be overused. On digital applications,\ntags should include some type of interactive state for a user and are best for hyperlinked buttons;\nBrackets should be used for quotes, subhead, and to\naccentuate key information. Double quotes should be\nused for quotes and highlighting information, and single\nquotes can be used for larger text including headlines and\nsecondary callouts. Brackets should be used sparingly\nand not more than 1-2 in a piece.;\nArrows\nArrows will be used to highlight content and draw attention to key information.Arrows should look lightweight and the arrow point should match the angle of our other shapes.

Longer\nheadlines should use GT America.\nSharp should always be set in CAPS. No\nsubstitutes for this typeface should be\nused if it is unavailable.\nOur primary serif is Tiempos, a family\nof fonts by Klim Type Foundry. We use\nTiempos when we are telling stories. It\nhas an editorial feel and really shines\nin the context of longform journalism.\nWe use it for story titles, blockquotes,\nand anything that is more than a few\nsentences long. When this brand font\nis unavailable, Times may be used as a\nsubstitute.\nFor body text or anything below 20pt,\nwe use Tiempos Text. It has all the\ncharacter of Tiempos Headline, but is\ndesigned to be highly legible at smaller\nsizes, especially on the web. We use it\nfor story excerpts, body text, caption\ntext, and the text that you are reading\nright now.

In advertising and promotions, do not display multiple authorizations. Display the single authorization that is most clearly related to a communication\u2019s content. For instance, an Apple Authorized Reseller may also be an Apple Authorized Education Reseller and an Apple Authorized Training Center.

So we must be very conscious of what we choose to emphasize when selecting images and/or cropping. Images should always seek to focus on the human experiences that American enables. Images should strive to capture a specific natural moment, illustrate interesting or unique perspectives and employ artful cropping. When selecting imagery, use bright, open and uncluttered images. Avoid clich\u00e9, trite or overly staged images and stay away from feathering or harsh vignetting.

All images of American planes should reinforce this narrative. All plane photography should demonstrate that American\u2019s fleet is new, clean, fuel - efficient and technologically advanced. Focus on capturing different angles that are dynamic and give a different perspective from what the average person sees. Showcase details of the plane (example: a picture underneath the plane showing its wheels) or the size and scale of the plane. Please be mindful and take into consideration an image's context when concepting out - of - home layouts.;\nLivery: Plane images can be cropped as long as care is taken to ensure that the logotype, Flight Symbol and/or livery are not cut off. At least one of the livery\u2019s two key design elements (tail or American logotype with the Flight Symbol) must be identifiable/recognizable and in context. Images cannot be cropped to only show a part of the plane that is not easily identifiable. The preferred side of the plane is the Starboard side \u2013 where the word \u201cAmerican\u201d and the Flight Symbol line up in the traditional fashion. The plane cannot be used as an icon or a design element. Livery Violations: Whenever cropping plane imagery, care must be taken to ensure that the logotype, Flight Symbol and/or livery are not cut off. Avoid using images of the plane that are expected or standard. Angles should be refreshing and dynamic. Imagery is one of the key elements we use to demonstrate the American brand identity. All imagery must consistently reinforce our brand narrative.;\nImage White Space: When selecting images, it is ideal to use bright and open images that do not require heavy retouching. Obviously, many images may require some retouching to add white space where text and other elements may need to be placed. The first thing to note is that white space is not meant to be taken literally; backgrounds could actually be gray or black or another solid color. Secondly, it is important that the white space you create feels like it occurs naturally in the image. That is, it should seem as though it is an organic part of the image rather than something added afterward. Avoid harsh lines or obviously vignetted images. Online banners should feature images that utilize the space of the banner. Images should not be small and artificially blended into the background.; \nillustrationStyles: \npictogramInstructions: \npictogramAllowNoContainer: \nmapInstructions: \npageMargin: \nhierarchy: \npurpose: \nmission: \nvision: \nvalues: \nbrand positioning: \nTarget Audience: \narchetype: \npersonality: \nemotions: \ntone of voice: fresh, bold, optimistic communications\nAmerican\u2019s advertising builds upon our iconic\nimage while still reflecting our more modern,\nvibrant and welcoming spirit.\nWriting rules: \nkey messages: \ngraphic elements: \nVisual samples: TRUE\nComponents: Print Price Point: All price points must align to approved standards. If editing a template, follow these rules to ensure all price point advertising will appear consistently: Price copy should be AmericanSans Light in AA Blue. The dollar sign ($) is a medium weight. Price point descriptors are set in AmericanSans Medium and AA Light Blue. If more description is required, it should be placed under the Round Trip descriptor and set in AmericanSans Regular and AA Gray. Price point descriptors should be a minimum of 5 pt. Secondary callouts (if necessary) are set in AmericanSans Medium,in AA Blue small caps and tracked out to +75 pts. ;\nOnline Price Point \u2013 Non-Panes: All price points must align to approved standards. If editing a template, follow these rules to ensure all price point advertising will appear consistently: Price point headline copy should conform to the same standards as subheads: AA Blue, small caps, and +75 point tracking. Rules are .25 pt and AA Gray. Or if on a dark background .25 and White. Copy should be set in sentence case, AmericanSans Light, and colored AA Dark Gray. Price points are set in AmericanSans Light and descriptors are set in AmericanSans Medium. Both are AA Blue. If more description is required, it should be placed under the Round Trip descriptor and set in\nAmericanSans Regular and AA Gray. Price point descriptors should be a minimum of 5 pt. Buttons should lock up to the right of the price point whenever possible. Buttons can lock up below the price point for certain layouts. Price point terms and conditions should be placed at the bottom of a unit in AA Gray or in close proximity to the price.;\nPanes: All price points must align to approved standards. Spacing between lines of the template will need to tighten to fit within the Panes template. Follow these rules to ensure all price point advertising will appear consistently: Headlines should be set in all caps, AmericanSans Light, and colored AA Blue. Subheads are all caps, AmericanSans Medium, and colored AA Blue. Price point headlines should be set in all caps, AmericanSans Light, and colored AA Dark Gray. Price points are set in AmericanSans Light and AA Blue. Price point terms and conditions should be placed in close proximity to the price. CTA copy should be set in all caps, AmericanSans Medium, and white.; \nOnline elements: When communicating online, advertising falls into two categories: Brand/Product and Transactional. To emphasize this difference, it is preferred that Brand statements use an AA Blue colored button while Transactional ads use a button colored AA Red. However, a red button may be used outside of transactional advertising whenever a blue button doesn't stand out enough from a darker background. All buttons must conform to approved shape and configurations. They should never be longer than the American logo. The type inside the button is AmericanSans Bold set in small caps and tracked out to +75 pts. Web banners require a 1 px AA Dark Gray key-line frame. 3 px, solid AA Blue borders. can also appear on the left and right edges of the banner. Brand and Product: 1 px. Key-line Stroke, Transactional: 3 px. Borders, Do not add a gradient to the blue borders. Blue borders are always a flat color.; \nOnline Animations: Every banner should incorporate some element of eye - catching movement, even if still imagery is used. The oneworld logo should fade in with the call - to - action button. However, if the ad message is about oneworld, the oneworld logo should animate in at the same time as the claim copy. Buttons can manifest a soft glow as a final call to action.; \nPanes: \"Panes\" is an interactive design system developed to be more dynamic than Standard templates with the goal of breaking through the clutter of external, third-party and paid environments. It echoes the new American Livery and brand language. Panes allows American's online communications to stand out as dynamic, energetic and modern. *Design concepts beyond Panes and the Standard template may be approved by Advertising clients, but these would qualify as exceptions and are for specific campaigns only.; \nVideo End Frames: When the end frame of a video features a URL, it always appears lowercase (e.g., aa.com/xxxx). Proper placement of the URL, oneworld logo and any hashtag is illustrated in Animation One or Animation Two. Specifications for exact placement differ based on\nscreen size. However, this placement is designed to accommodate center\u2013cut TV safety margins. The diagram in Animation Three demonstrates where the full logo fades in over the image, along with the proper placement of the URL and oneworld logo. End frames do not have to follow rule of thirds and other scaling guidelines.; \nOut-of-Home Advertising instructions: TRUE\nOTHER: \nwebsite: https://www.americanairlines.jp/intl/jp/index.jsp"}]}

It acts as a signature, an identifier, and a stamp of quality. These guidelines detail how to use our logo consistently across all communications.\nThe full color green logo is our preferred version and should be used wherever possible.\nLOGO USAGE\nClearance Area: Fit width of\nsmaller A on all four sides\nTo ensure the legibility of the logo always maintain a minimum clearance space around the logo.

For it to remain easily recognizable, it\u2019s\nimperative we maintain graphic unity and a consistent look across a\nwide variety of correct applications.\nOur logo can consist of two primary elements: icon and logotype.\nThe logo must always be asymmetrical with the icon to the left. Never\nmanipulate this alignment in any way.\nTRADEMARK AND REGISTRATION SYMBOLS\nWhen the ScanSource logotype is used, it must have the \u201cCircle R\u201d\nregistration mark in the upper-right corner.\n\u2022  \nThe registration mark should always be 40% gray.\n\u2022  \nThe registration mark should be used alongside the icon, or when\nthe icon is independent of the logotype.\n\u2022  \nThe registration mark\u2019s size should never change in proportion to\nthe logo.

The icon should have clear lines in\nbetween the diagonals to delineate the \u201cs\u201d mark.\nBRAND GUIDELINES 17\n\fLOGO\nFour-color on black\nFour-color on color\n(unless red, orange, or gray)\nFour-color on light blend\nAcceptable\nusage\nOne-color\nWatermark (15%-40% black)\nEmbroidered logo in use\nFour-color on dark blend\nGrayscale on color\nOne-color reversed\nBRAND GUIDELINES\n18\n\fBRAND GUIDELINES 19\n\fLOGO\nUnacceptable\nusage\nDo not append text to the icon or logotype other\nthan options expressly approved in this guide\nDo not stretch the icon or logotype.

This ensures a clear reproduction\nof the logo and other elements. If the physical size of a product or\nplacement won\u2019t accommodate a minimum size logo, please speak with\nWorldwide Creative + Brand.\nEMBROIDERY SIZE Due to size limitations with embroidery, we\nwill only use the ScanSource corporate logo with no technology\ndescriptor on embroidered specialty items. The minimum width for\nan embroidered logo is 2.75\u201d.\n2.75\u201d\n1.25\u201d or 90 pixels\nISOLATION AREA Always maintain a minimum clearance with an\nx-height equal to the height of the lowercase \u201cn\u201d in the ScanSource\nlogotype.\nBRAND GUIDELINES\n22\n\fTone and\nstyling\nWhen referring to ScanSource in copy, always capitalize both letter S\u2019s. Don\u2019t\nabbreviate ScanSource as \u201cSCSC\u201d except when specifically referring to our\nNASDAQ listing symbol.\nTypically our approach with all messaging\u2014be it internal or external\u2014is to\ncome across as relaxed, approachable, friendly, and confident yet polished and\nprofessional.\nWhatever the subject, we maintain a helpful, positive tone that conveys\nour experience and expertise, as well as our eagerness to learn about a new\ncustomer, technology, manufacturer, mandate, or more.\nTo our resellers, we\u2019re always optimistic as we tell them how a new product,\npromo, or program can \u201chelp\u201d them grown their businesses. We avoid saying we\n\u201cwill\u201d grow their businesses. And we refrain from using the word \u201cmargin\u201d when\nwriting to an external audience.\nA big part of our reseller writing is finding the tightest, most-accurate way of\nsaying, \u201cThis product is great for your end-user customer and you should sell it\nto them. Here\u2019s what to tell them about it. And, by the way, the best place to buy\nthis is at ScanSource because of this [fill in the blank with promotion, rebate,\nprovisioning service\u2014or any other reason that applies].\u201d\nFinally, whether we\u2019re speaking to our employees or to an external audience, we\nalways include phrasing that conveys our deep gratitude for their hard work\n(to employees) or for their partnerships (community agencies, supplier and\nreseller partners, and more).\nBRAND GUIDELINES 23\n\fLockup\nUSE WITH OTHER LOGOS\nThe ScanSource logo should always be placed\nfirst, or on the left side, of any supplier logos in\nany application. When vertically stacked, the\nScanSource logo should be placed above any\nsupplier logos. For any special considerations,\nincluding smaller placements on digital banners,\netc., please contact Worldwide Creative + Brand.\nLOGO\nBRAND GUIDELINES\n24\n\fPlacement\nWhenever possible, the ScanSource logo\nshould be placed in the top-left corner.\nWhen not possible, secondary placement\nshould be in the bottom right corner.\nDIGITAL\nBRAND GUIDELINES 25\nPRINT\n\fCOLORS\nStrict control over the colors used to represent our brand is imperative for consistency. The only acceptable colors\nare listed to the right.\nPlease don\u2019t veer from these standards without explicit permission from Worldwide Creative + Brand.\nPROMOTIONAL MATERIALS\nFor promotional-material application, such as embroidery and screen printing, tone on tone is acceptable with the\napproved specialty version of the corporate logo designated on page 21.\nSPECIALTY PRINTING\nBlind-emboss or foil-stamp applications are acceptable, where appropriate, with the approved specialty version of\nthe corporate logo designated on page 21. However, colors must match our standards, or a clear foil must be laid\nover a proper spot production of PMS colors. Acceptable one-color foil colors are black, white, gold, or silver.\nPRIMARY COLORS\nUse primary colors for headline type, callouts, backgrounds, body text, ScanSource icons, and supergraphics. Some\nexceptions can be made based on the nature of the work and the environment.\nSECONDARY COLORS\nThe secondary brand colors should only be used in instances where a differentiation in color, other than the primary\nbrand colors, is needed. For example, a chart in a ScanSource-branded PowerPoint that requires six or more colors.\nSCANSOURCE GRAYS\nUse them for functional purposes such as highlighted information, charts, and graphs. Don\u2019t use these colors for\nbody copy or headlines.

We speak to the customer casually\nand directly as if we were having a conversation in person.\nWe\u2019re a good listener, looking for ways to be helpful and\nreassuring, but recognizing when it\u2019s better to remain quiet.\nWe\u2019re compassionate and remember that the customer is\nsometimes shopping in a second language, is sometimes sight\nimpaired, and always has a different perspective than we do.\nWe keep it simple and don\u2019t ask the customer to understand\nhow Amazon works or to learn our terminology, because\neverything we do is about putting the customer at ease.\nAuthentic\u2014\nWe amplify the truth and let it speak for itself. We work\nbackwards from real customer problems, so we don\u2019t need\nto make exaggerated claims. We look for opportunities to\nrelay genuine customer stories and to show people as they\nreally are\u2014our customers don\u2019t live in a stock photo world,\nand we shouldn\u2019t portray them as such. We don\u2019t talk about\nourselves. We stay focused on the customer, and on the\nthings our creations help the customer to achieve.\nOptimistic\u2014\nWe emphasize expansion and possibility, rather than\nlimitations and prohibitions. We\u2019re excited about the future\nwe\u2019re helping to create, and we express this optimism to the\ncustomer in everything from our color palettes and language\nchoices, to our photography and TV commercials. We\u2019re bright\nand open, not cool and sleek. We don\u2019t tell the customer\nwhat they can\u2019t do, we offer solutions and help the customer\ndiscover new options. This sense of boundless possibility\nmakes the customer feel like Amazon is always the right place\nto start, whatever their needs.\nEmpowering\u2014\nWe transform the impossible into the expected. We\u2019re\nconstantly inventing on behalf of the customer to reduce\nfriction and make life more simple. From eReaders to Echo,\nfrom Dash Buttons to Drones, sometimes we\u2019re at our best\nwhen we raise the bar so high that the customer isn\u2019t even\nsure it\u2019s for real. But often our greatest innovations feel like\nthey\u2019ve been there all along, like a 1-Click button or free\nsame-day shipping. It\u2019s nice when the customer admires\nour inventions, but we\u2019re most happy when our inventions\ndisappear into the everyday.\nDelightful\u2014\nIn everything we create, we find memorable ways to make\nthe customer smile. We create experiences that are fun,\nfrictionless, and beautiful. We believe that simplicity is the\ngreatest delighter of all, but simplicity alone isn\u2019t enough.\nWe\u2019re always looking for one more way to make each\nexperience a little less ordinary, whether that be a quirky\nimage in a gateway ad or a hint of unexpected humor in a\nUI message. It\u2019s about making that extra little effort every\ntime, because we aren\u2019t just building a series of online\ntransactions\u2014we\u2019re creating a place for amusement,\nentertainment, and human connection.\n4\nAMAZON BRAND GUIDELINES\u2014LAST UPDATED 02/22/2017\nAMAZON BRAND GUIDELINES\nKey Brand Traits\u2014Who We Are\n\fThis is the primary Amazon logo.\nThe primary logo should be your\nfirst choice for all marketing needs.\n5\nAMAZON BRAND GUIDELINES\u2014LAST UPDATED 02/22/2017\nAMAZON BRAND GUIDELINES\nPrimary Logo\n\fAt we...

We speak to the customer casually and directly as if we were having a conversation in person.\nWe\u2019re a good listener, looking for ways to be helpful and reassuring, but recognizing when it\u2019s better to remain quiet. We\u2019re compassionate and remember that the customer is sometimes shopping in a second language, is sometimes sight impaired, and always has a different perspective than we do. We keep it simple and don\u2019t ask the customer to understand how Amazon works or to learn our terminology, because everything we do is about putting the customer at ease.\n\nAuthentic\u2014\nWe amplify the truth and let it speak for itself. We work\nbackwards from real customer problems, so we don\u2019t need\nto make exaggerated claims. We look for opportunities to\nrelay genuine customer stories and to show people as they\nreally are\u2014our customers don\u2019t live in a stock photo world,\nand we shouldn\u2019t portray them as such. We don\u2019t talk about\nourselves. We stay focused on the customer, and on the\nthings our creations help the customer to achieve.\n\nOptimistic\u2014\nWe emphasize expansion and possibility, rather than\nlimitations and prohibitions. We\u2019re excited about the future\nwe\u2019re helping to create, and we express this optimism to the\ncustomer in everything from our color palettes and language\nchoices, to our photography and TV commercials. We\u2019re bright\nand open, not cool and sleek. We don\u2019t tell the customer\nwhat they can\u2019t do, we offer solutions and help the customer\ndiscover new options. This sense of boundless possibility\nmakes the customer feel like Amazon is always the right place\nto start, whatever their needs.\n\nEmpowering\u2014\nWe transform the impossible into the expected. We\u2019re\nconstantly inventing on behalf of the customer to reduce\nfriction and make life more simple. From eReaders to Echo,\nfrom Dash Buttons to Drones, sometimes we\u2019re at our best\nwhen we raise the bar so high that the customer isn\u2019t even\nsure it\u2019s for real. But often our greatest innovations feel like\nthey\u2019ve been there all along, like a 1-Click button or free\nsame-day shipping. It\u2019s nice when the customer admires\nour inventions, but we\u2019re most happy when our inventions\ndisappear into the everyday.\n\nDelightful\u2014\nIn everything we create, we find memorable ways to make\nthe customer smile. We create experiences that are fun,\nfrictionless, and beautiful. We believe that simplicity is the\ngreatest delighter of all, but simplicity alone isn\u2019t enough.\nWe\u2019re always looking for one more way to make each\nexperience a little less ordinary, whether that be a quirky\nimage in a gateway ad or a hint of unexpected humor in a\nUI message. It\u2019s about making that extra little effort every\ntime, because we aren\u2019t just building a series of online\ntransactions\u2014we\u2019re creating a place for amusement,\nentertainment, and human connection.\nbrand positioning: \nTarget Audience: \narchetype: \npersonality: \nemotions: \ntone of voice: We enable the triumph of the everyday hero.\n\nWhen are we at our best?\nWhen we\u2019re at our best\u2014when we\u2019re working backwards from the customer and embodying our Peculiar Ways\u2014we create experiences that invite customers to see our finest qualities: We\u2019re welcoming, authentic, optimistic, empowering, and delightful.\n\nHelps us to focus on who we are, so that we consistently present ourselves to the customer in our finest light.\nWriting rules: \nkey messages: \ngraphic elements: \nVisual samples: FALSE\nComponents: \nOut-of-Home Advertising instructions: \nOTHER: \nwebsite: https://www.amazon.co.jp/"}]}

It serves as a foundational,\ninternal statement to guide a company or organization\u2019s marketing\nstrategies.\nThe Bloch School gives students the belief, courage and tools\nto build businesses, shape communities and lead the future.\nBrand Idea\nA brand idea is a simple phrase or statement that clarifies why the brand\nis important in the eyes and hearts of the target audience. It is more than\nwhat you do and how you do it. It defines your purpose, your cause,\nyour belief. It summarizes \u201cwhy\u201d your organization exists and why anyone\nshould care. What you do only serves as proof of your belief.\nWe are committed to growing Kansas City\u2019s leadership,\nand you are our future.\nBrand Driver\nThe positioning statement and brand idea lead us to a key brand driver.\nThe brand driver is a word, phrase or notion that captures the essence of\nthe brand\u2019s promise and is relevant to the target audience. As the driver,\nit must be clear and simple \u2013 to intuitively stimulate every brand-related\nactivity and behavior. It must be simple and memorable and drive inspired\nbranding.\nKansas City\u2019s Business School\nA brand is an organization\u2019s avenue to building an image\nand a relationship with its audience. It has both functional\nand emotional elements, which convey the \u201cheart and soul\u201d\nof what it stands for and its promise of what it brings that\u2019s\nunique to the marketplace. The brand platform consists of\nseveral building blocks that collectively form the overall Bloch\nSchool brand.\nOur brand platform defines the tone for our key messages,\nencompassing our focus on being KC\u2019s business school,\nwith an entrepreneurial, connected and inspired spirit.\nThis concept should resonate throughout all branded\nmaterials.

It should sound equally inspirational and aspirational, leading\nstudents to conclude that the Bloch School will help them be better\nequipped to prosper and advance. Whenever possible, focus on\ntalking \u201cto\u201d rather than \u201cat\u201d your audience.

The same rules for\nthis wordmark apply to the reverse\nworkmark.\nLETTERMARK\nThe Bloch lettermark may be\nused in special circumstances\nas a visual identifier of the Bloch\nSchool.

Just remember that the LEGO Brand Identity\n& Experience always should be used as a starting\npoint to ensure the LEGO Brand is positioned in a\nunique and globally consistent way.\nLEGO\u00ae\nBrand Framework\nThe LEGO\u00ae\nBrand Framework guides us as an\norganization.

When engaging consumers and shoppers in\nLEGO experiences, such experiences should also express the essence\nof the LEGO brand by enabling participation, dialogue, co-creation\nand if possible drive further sharing of LEGO experiences.\nBrand Identity & Experience\n\fPersonality\nThe human-like characteristics that de\ufb01ne how the brand behaves \u2013 \u2018my LEGO friend\u2019.\nJust as human personalities a\ufb00ect relationships between people, the LEGO brand personality can\nbe the basis of a relationship between our consumers and the LEGO brand.

Understanding. Appreciation.\nGiving people the benefit of the doubt and the respect that\nis due to them. Being human and recognizing the humanity in\nothers. Being understanding and appreciative.\nCourtesy\nKindness. Generosity. Thoughtfulness.\nMaking an effort to save others time (everyone\u2019s time is\nimportant, regardless of rank or title).

Flourishing.\nTaking this opportunity to do the best work of your life and\nsupporting others in doing the same. Taking pleasure in the\nexercise of your craft and playing with your whole heart.\nEngaging your responsibilities with drive, inspiration\nand presence.\nBrand values\n\f11 Slack Brand Guidelines Defining our brand\nWe are creative,\nprofessional,\nthoughtful, respectful,\npurposeful and\ncurious; we are smart,\nhumble, hardworking\nand collaborative.\nOur culture turned inward creates our product; our culture\nturned outward creates our brand.\nOur brand is a reflection of who we are as a company and\nwhat we represent in the world of work.\nIf nothing else, our outward-facing brand should represent\nthe best of what we bring to work as colleagues at this\ncompany. Smart, humble, hardworking and collaborative.\nWe are deliberately human\u2014we aim to be an ideal\ncolleague: One who works on the basis of respect\nand admiration for working people; someone who\ncommunicates in a way that is smart, humble, hardworking\nand collaborative. Who doesn\u2019t dominate the conversation\nand never wastes your time; who knows the answer (and the\ncontext) if you have a question\u2014and shows you how to find\nit yourself.\nWe demonstrate our commitment to being customer-\ncentric by placing those humans at the center of every\ncommunication, not ourselves.\nPersona and personality\n\f12 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\n\f13 Slack Brand Guidelines Defining our brand\nThe key to sounding\nlike Slack is speaking\ndirectly to the user, in\na voice that they can\nhear and recognize.\nWe are humans, speaking to humans. We distinguish\nourselves from other business communication software\nthrough the way we use design and language to make\ncommunication feel simpler and more pleasant. By being\ndeliberate and thoughtful with the way we use language, we\nencourage people to feel a deeper connection with Slack\u2014\nand how they use it with their coworkers.\nWhile we intend to have a more conversational, human tone\nin the main, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re overly informal.\nOur tone will vary depending on the audience, the context\nand the information we need to get across.\nOur voice isn\u2019t just an intrinsic part of the product, it\u2019s\nan external representation of the people behind it. And\nbecause of that, we aren\u2019t necessarily making hard rules\nabout what to say or what not to say. But some of the rules\nare a little firm.\nVoice and tone\n\f14 Slack Brand Guidelines Defining our brand\nHere\u2019s what we are (and aren\u2019t):\n\u2022 Confident (never cocky)\n\u2022 Witty (but never silly)\n\u2022 Conversational (but always appropriate\nand respectful)\n\u2022 Intelligent (and we always treat our users\nas intelligent too)\n\u2022 Friendly (but not ingratiating)\n\u2022 Helpful (never overbearing)\n\u2022 Clear, concise and human\nWe are characterful. But we never let character overwhelm\ncontent. What we have to say is infinitely more important\nthan being admired for the way we say it. If people can\u2019t see\nthe substance for the style, we\u2019ve gone wrong.\nIn writing, we value perspicuity above all. Be clear, be\nconcise, omit unnecessary words, make sure that whatever\nyou say has purpose, but don\u2019t be robotic. Contractions are\nyour friend.\nWe don\u2019t use cheap words that recall the failures of those\ncompanies that have gone before us, and we don\u2019t use\nSilicon Valley clich\u00e9s and jargon. We would only describe\npeople as ninjas or rock stars if they were actually those\nthings for a living. We don\u2019t lean on pop culture references\nor things that feel exclusionary.\nWe are considerate and intentional with the words we use.\nWe recognize and appreciate the power of language, and\nuse it with eloquence and elegance (while never getting\ncarried away with ourselves).\nVoice and tone\n\f15 Slack Brand Guidelines Defining our brand\nNor do we mess around with Slack. We don\u2019t use Slacker/\nSlacking/Slackee to describe who we are or what we\ndo. That means no \u201cHappy Slacking!\u201d to sign off emails,\nno matter how catchy a phrase it might be. While other\npeople are free to make up whatever word they want to\ndescribe Slack usage or someone who uses it, we do not\n(externally) claim any of these as official terms. That\u2019s up to\nothers to decide. Something will surface eventually and be\norganically adopted.\nIt should go without saying, but it\u2019s still worth stating:\nNever use exclusionary terms, cultural appropriation,\nableist or misgendering language, or anything that could be\ninterpreted as a slur. If you\u2019re on the fence about whether\nyou\u2019re using something that could be taken as offensive,\ninflammatory or exclusionary, find another word.\nWe are authentic.\nWe like the people\nwe\u2019re talking to.\nWe\u2019re proud of\nwhat we\u2019re talking\nabout. That itself\nsets us apart.\nVoice and tone\n\f16 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nSection 2: Design elements\nIn this section, we outline best practices for the use of\nSlack brand assets and offer useful examples.\n\f17 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nOctothorpe\n19x19 grid\nThe octothorpe\nThe octothorpe is composed of\nsimple geometric shapes and four\nprimary colors.\nThe symbol is legible at most sizes,\nand a small version is provided for\nmicro applications.\nThe two basic shapes used in the\noctothorpe\u2014a speech bubble and a\nlozenge\u2014can be extracted and used\nas graphic elements.\n\f18 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nOur logo\nThe Slack logo is composed of an\noctothorpe and a logotype set in\nHellix Bold.\nThe horizontal logo is the primary logo\nand should be used in most instances.\nThe stacked logo is for large-scale use.\nAvoid using at small sizes, as it can\nbecome illegible.\nAlways use the logo files provided.\nDo not re-create.\n\f19 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\n50px wide, approx.\n(or approx. 0.7 inches)\n90px wide, approx.\n(or approx. 1.25 inches)\n20px height, approx.\n(or approx. 0.28 inches)\n15px height, approx.\n(or approx. 0.2 inches)\nMaximum Sizing for\nSmall Use Logo\nMinimum Sizing for\nSmall Use Logo\nOur logo (for small use)\nThere is a specific logo for small sizes\nand should be used when the logo is\nrendered at a size between 50px wide\nand 90px wide.\nThe small logo mark should be used at\na size between 15px tall and 20px tall.\nOnly the horizontal logos are\nappropriate for small use. Do not use\nthe stacked logo for small use.\n\f20 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nUsage on backgrounds\nThe full-color logos should be\nused only on white, black or\naubergine backgrounds.\nAvoid using full-color logos on\nphotographs unless the logo sits on\na black or white area of the image.\n\f21 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nOne-color use\nThe one-color logo should be used only\non photographs and color backgrounds\nwithin the Slack color palette.\nThe one-color logo should be only on\nblack and white colorways.\nIf using an aubergine background, we\nstrongly prefer to use the full-color\nlogo.

That demand is why Slack is here today, and\nwhy Slack is being adopted all over the world. Email\nis the default coordinating point for communications\nand the go-to platform enterprise software develop-\ners use when they need to reach human beings, but\ninside a company it works poorly. Enormous flows\nof information course through it, but each person\nhas only a tiny view. Email holds rich history: all the\ndecisions made, questions answered and information\nshared, but if you\u2019re new to a company, or just in the\nShare channels with companies\nand businesses you regularly work\nwith to bring all the right people\ninto the same space.\nwrong inbox, you have access to none of it. Rather\nthan inboxes, all those messages are organized into\nchannels. Channels can correspond to anything - proj-\nects, teams, planning, office locations, business units,\nfunctional areas, temporary channels for things like\nplanning an offsite. Unlike email, Slack was designed\nfrom the bottom-up to integrate with the software\ntools you use every day. Whatever tools you already\nuse, Slack vastly increases the value of your software\ninvestment, by making it easier to access, easier to\nact upon, and easier to share.\nWe believe that the advantages are so great\nthat a shift to working on Slack, or something\nlike it, is inevitable.\nMarcel Gherkins\nSpokesperson, Slack\nType specimen: Ideal stack\n\f30 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\n\f31 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nLocalized languages\nJapanese\nTazugane is our brand font for Japan,\nNoto Sans is used for the Slack\nApp/UI and M PLUS 1 p is used for\nGoogle Slides.\nFont size is 15% smaller than English.\nIn general, Japanese characters tend\nto be bigger than Roman letters and\nnumbers even when set at the same\nfont size (with \u201cWestern\u201d fonts, in\nparticular).\nPortuguese, Spanish, French\nand German\nFont size is 10% smaller than English,\nallowing for 20-30% more characters.\n\f32 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nBrand architecture\nThe Slack logo and mark are used in a series of\nlogo lockups to represent the various programs,\ndepartments, teams, groups, initiatives and\npartnerships of our organization.\nOur lockup categories are primary, secondary and\npartnership, which establish identities for external\nand internal entities and partnerships, respectively.\nHere, we break\ndown the use\nof different logo\nlockups for entities\nin and outside of\nSlack.\n\f33 Slack Brand Guidelines Design elements\nPrimary lockup\nThe primary lockup is used for external-\nfacing entities that represent an\nextension of the Slack master brand.\nThese are programs, products, events\nand groups with the highest potential\nfor external visibility to promote brand\nrecognition.\nWe lock up the Slack logo with the\nentity name.

Smart, humble, hardworking and collaborative.\nWe are deliberately human\u2014we aim to be an ideal\ncolleague: One who works on the basis of respect\nand admiration for working people; someone who\ncommunicates in a way that is smart, humble, hardworking\nand collaborative. Who doesn\u2019t dominate the conversation\nand never wastes your time; who knows the answer (and the\ncontext) if you have a question\u2014and shows you how to find\nit yourself.\n\nWe demonstrate our commitment to being customer-\ncentric by placing those humans at the center of every\n\ncommunication, not ourselves.\nemotions: \ntone of voice: The key to sounding\nlike Slack is speaking\ndirectly to the user, in\na voice that they can\nhear and recognize.\n\nWe are humans, speaking to humans. We distinguish\nourselves from other business communication software\nthrough the way we use design and language to make\ncommunication feel simpler and more pleasant. By being\ndeliberate and thoughtful with the way we use language, we\nencourage people to feel a deeper connection with Slack\u2014\nand how they use it with their coworkers.\nWhile we intend to have a more conversational, human tone\nin the main, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re overly informal.\nOur tone will vary depending on the audience, the context\nand the information we need to get across.\nOur voice isn\u2019t just an intrinsic part of the product, it\u2019s\nan external representation of the people behind it. And\nbecause of that, we aren\u2019t necessarily making hard rules\nabout what to say or what not to say. But some of the rules\nare a little firm.;\n\nHere\u2019s what we are (and aren\u2019t):\n\n\u2022 Confident (never cocky)\n\u2022 Witty (but never silly)\n\u2022 Conversational (but always appropriate\nand respectful)\n\u2022 Intelligent (and we always treat our users\nas intelligent too)\n\u2022 Friendly (but not ingratiating)\n\u2022 Helpful (never overbearing)\n\u2022 Clear, concise and human\n\nWe are characterful. But we never let character overwhelm\ncontent. What we have to say is infinitely more important\nthan being admired for the way we say it. If people can\u2019t see\nthe substance for the style, we\u2019ve gone wrong.\nIn writing, we value perspicuity above all. Be clear, be\nconcise, omit unnecessary words, make sure that whatever\nyou say has purpose, but don\u2019t be robotic. Contractions are\nyour friend.\nWe don\u2019t use cheap words that recall the failures of those\ncompanies that have gone before us, and we don\u2019t use\nSilicon Valley clich\u00e9s and jargon. We would only describe\npeople as ninjas or rock stars if they were actually those\nthings for a living. We don\u2019t lean on pop culture references\nor things that feel exclusionary.\nWe are considerate and intentional with the words we use.\nWe recognize and appreciate the power of language, and\nuse it with eloquence and elegance (while never getting\ncarried away with ourselves).; \n\nNor do we mess around with Slack. We don\u2019t use Slacker/\nSlacking/Slackee to describe who we are or what we\ndo. That means no \u201cHappy Slacking!\u201d to sign off emails,\nno matter how catchy a phrase it might be. While other\npeople are free to make up whatever word they want to\ndescribe Slack usage or someone who uses it, we do not\n(externally) claim any of these as official terms. That\u2019s up to\nothers to decide. Something will surface eventually and be\norganically adopted.\nIt should go without saying, but it\u2019s still worth stating:\nNever use exclusionary terms, cultural appropriation,\nableist or misgendering language, or anything that could be\ninterpreted as a slur. If you\u2019re on the fence about whether\nyou\u2019re using something that could be taken as offensive,\ninflammatory or exclusionary, find another word.\n\nWe are authentic.\nWe like the people\nwe\u2019re talking to.\nWe\u2019re proud of\nwhat we\u2019re talking\nabout. That itself\nsets us apart.\nWriting rules: Please use \u201cSlack\u201d as an adjective followed by a description of our services. \u201cSlack\u201d should not be used as a noun, verb, plural or possessive; \nkey messages: How we describe the need for Slack\n\nChallenge\nThe fundamental challenge common to all organizations\nis one of coordination: the creation and maintenance\nof alignment over time; the ability to turn groups of\nindividuals moving in many directions into teams moving\nin the same direction.\nSolution\nSlack offers a new choice: a better way to work together\nby replacing email inside companies of all sizes; providing\na place that connects their conversations, information\nand software.\nResult\nWith Slack, we all have the power to do our best work\u2014\nindividuals, teams, organizations and even software.\ngraphic elements: The two basic shapes used in the octothorpe\u2014a speech bubble and a lozenge\u2014can be extracted and used as graphic elements.\nVisual samples: \nComponents: \nOut-of-Home Advertising instructions: \nOTHER: \nwebsite: https://slack.com/intl/ "}]}
